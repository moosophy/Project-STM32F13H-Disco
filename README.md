# Embedded Systems - Sensor & External Display Project

This is a personal embedded systems project made for a university course. The goal is to put into practice what we‚Äôve learned during the classes. In this project, we will set up communication between accelerometer, an OLED display, and STM32F413H-Disco microcontroller. The OLED screen will be used to show the data coming from the accelerometer in real time.
